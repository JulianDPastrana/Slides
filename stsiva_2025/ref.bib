	ABSTRACT = {Accurate streamflow forecasting is crucial for effectively managing water resources, particularly in countries like Colombia, where hydroelectric power generation significantly contributes to the national energy grid. Although highly interpretable, traditional deterministic, physically-driven models often suffer from complexity and require extensive parameterization. Data-driven models like Linear Autoregressive (LAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks offer simplicity and performance but cannot quantify uncertainty. This work introduces Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (SVGPs) for forecasting streamflow contributions. The proposed SVGP model reduces computational complexity compared to traditional Gaussian Processes, making it highly scalable for large datasets. The methodology employs optimal hyperparameters and shared inducing points to capture short-term and long-term relationships among reservoirs. Training, validation, and analysis of the proposed approach consider the streamflow dataset from 23 geographically dispersed reservoirs recorded during twelve years in Colombia. Performance assessment reveals that the proposal outperforms baseline Linear Autoregressive (LAR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in three key aspects: adaptability to changing dynamics, provision of informative confidence intervals through Bayesian inference, and enhanced forecasting accuracy. Therefore, the SVGP-based forecasting methodology offers a scalable and interpretable solution for multi-output streamflow forecasting, thereby contributing to more effective water resource management and hydroelectric planning.},

	abstract={Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) leverage the flexibility and interpretability of GPs while capturing structure across outputs, which is desirable, for example, in spatio-temporal modelling. The key problem with MOGPs is their computational scaling $O(n^3 p^3)$, which is cubic in the number of both inputs $n$ (e.g., time points or locations) and outputs $p$. For this reason, a popular class of MOGPs assumes that the data live around a low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing the complexity to $O(n^3 m^3)$. However, this cost is still cubic in the dimensionality of the subspace $m$, which is still prohibitively expensive for many applications. We propose the use of a sufficient statistic of the data to accelerate inference and learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method achieves linear scaling in $m$ in practice, allowing these models to scale to large $m$ without sacrificing significant expressivity or requiring approximation. This advance opens up a wide range of real-world tasks and can be combined with existing GP approximations in a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on various synthetic and real-world data sets.}

The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform inference in the model by approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection (number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set containing only 150 examples.}

	ABSTRACT={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the kind of dementia that affects the most people around the world. Therefore, an early identification supporting effective treatments is required to increase the life quality of a wide number of patients. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis tools for dementia using Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans have been successfully proposed to discriminate between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. Most of the attention has been given to the clinical data, provided by initiatives as the ADNI, supporting reliable researches on intervention, prevention, and treatments of AD. Therefore, there is a need for improving the performance of classification machines. In this paper, we propose a kernel framework for learning metrics that enhances conventional machines and supports the diagnosis of dementia. Our framework aims at building discriminative spaces through the maximization of center kernel alignment function, aiming at improving the discrimination of the three considered neurological classes. The proposed metric learning performance is evaluated on the widely-known ADNI database using three supervised classification machines (k-nn, SVM and NNs) for multi-class and bi-class scenarios from structural MRIs. Specifically, from ADNI collection 286 AD patients, 379 MCI patients and 231 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed metric learning framework. For the experimental validation, we split the data into two subsets: 30% of subjects used like a blindfolded assessment and 70% employed for parameter tuning. Then, in the preprocessing stage, each structural MRI scan a total of 310 morphological measurements are automatically extracted from by <monospace>FreeSurfer</monospace> software package and concatenated to build an input feature matrix. Obtained test performance results, show that including a supervised metric learning improves the compared baseline classifiers in both scenarios. In the multi-class scenario, we achieve the best performance (accuracy 60.1%) for pretrained 1-layered NN, and we obtain measures over 90% in the average for HC vs. AD task. From the machine learning point of view, our proposal enhances the classifier performance by building spaces with a better class separability. From the clinical application, our enhancement results in a more balanced performance in each class than the compared approaches from the CADDementia challenge by increasing the sensitivity of pathological groups and the specificity of healthy controls.}

There are a considerable number of forecasting models and techniques that have been employed in streamflow forecasting and gained importance in hydrological studies in recent decades. In this study, the main objective was to compare the accuracy of four data-driven techniques of Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in daily streamflow forecasting. For this purpose, three scenarios were defined based on historical precipitation and streamflow series for 26 years of the Kentucky River basin located in eastern Kentucky, US. Statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation ($R$), Nash-Sutcliff coefficient of efficiency ($E$), Nash-Sutcliff for High flow ($E_H$), Nash-Sutcliff for Low flow ($E_L$), normalized root mean square error ($NRMSE$), relative error in estimating maximum flow ($RE_{\text{max}}$), threshold statistics ($TS$), and average absolute relative error ($AARE$) were employed to compare the performances of these methods. The results show that the LSTM network outperforms the other models in forecasting daily streamflow with the lowest values of $NRMSE$ and the highest values of $E_H$, $E_L$, and $R$ under all scenarios. These findings indicated that the LSTM is a robust data-driven technique to characterize the time series behaviors in hydrological modeling applications.},

	ABSTRACT = {River flow modeling plays a crucial role in water resource management and ensuring its sustainability. Therefore, in recent years, in addition to the prediction of hydrological processes through modeling, applicable and highly reliable methods have also been used to analyze the sustainability of water resources. Artificial neural networks and deep learning-based hybrid models have been used by scientists in river flow predictions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid approach, integrating long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks and a genetic algorithm (GA) for streamflow forecasting. The performance of the hybrid model and the benchmark model was taken into account using daily flow data. For this purpose, the daily river flow time series of the Beyderesi-K&#305;layak flow measurement station (FMS) from September 2000 to June 2019 and the data from Yaz&#305;k&ouml;y from December 2000 to June 2018 were used for flow measurements on the Euphrates River in Turkey. To validate the performance of the model, the first 80% of the data were used for training, and the remaining 20% were used for the testing of the two FMSs. Statistical methods such as linear regression was used during the comparison process to assess the proposed method&rsquo;s performance and to demonstrate its superior predictive ability. The estimation results of the models were evaluated with RMSE, MAE, MAPE, STD and R2 statistical metrics. The comparison of daily streamflow predictions results revealed that the LSTM-GA model provided promising accuracy results and mainly presented higher performance than the benchmark model and the linear regression model.},

	ABSTRACT = {Medium-range streamflow forecasts largely depend on the accuracy of meteorological forecasts. Due to large errors in precipitation forecasts, most streamflow forecasts based on deep learning rely only on historical data. Here, we apply a cascade Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast daily streamflow over 49 watersheds in the Yangtze River basin for up to 15 days. The first layer of the cascade LSTM model uses atmospheric circulation factors to predict future precipitation, and the second layer uses forecast precipitation to predict streamflow. The results show that the default LSTM model provides skillful streamflow forecasts over most watersheds. At the lead times of 1, 7, and 15 days, the streamflow Kling&ndash;Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 78%, 30%, and 20% watersheds are greater than 0.5, respectively. Its performance improves with the increase in drainage area. After implementing the cascade LSTM model, 61&ndash;88% of the watersheds show increased KGE at different leads, and the increase is more obvious at longer leads. Using cascade LSTM with perfect future precipitation shows further improvement, especially over small watersheds. In general, cascade LSTM modeling is a good attempt for streamflow forecasts over the Yangtze River, and it has a potential to connect with dynamical meteorological forecasts.},

Properties of multivariate Gaussians mean that they can be combined linearly in the manner of additive models and via a link function (like in generalized linear models) to handle non-Gaussian data. However, the link function formalism is restrictive, link functions are always invertible and must convert a parameter of interest to an linear combination of the underlying processes. There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term these more general models "Chained Gaussian Processes": the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on a range of likelihood functions.}

	abstract = {Water is the fundamental natural resource that supports life, ecosystems and human society. Thus studying the water cycle is important for sustainable development. In the context of global climate change, a better understanding of the water cycle is needed. This study summarises current research and highlights future directions of water science from four perspectives: (i) the water cycle; (ii) hydrologic processes; (iii) coupled natural-social water systems; and (iv) integrated watershed management. Emphasis should be placed on understanding the joint impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes and water resources across temporal and spatial scales. Understanding the interactions between land and atmosphere are keys to addressing this issue. Furthermore systematic approaches should be developed for large basin studies. Areas for focused research include: variations of cryosphere hydrological processes in upper alpine zones; and human activities on the water cycle and relevant biogeochemical processes in middle-lower reaches. Because the water cycle is naturally coupled with social characteristics across multiple scales, multi-process and multi-scale models are needed.

The disposal of hazardous pollutants in water resources is one of the biggest global concerns and poses many risks to human health and aquatic life. Therefore, the control of hazardous pollutants in water resources plays an important role, when it comes to evaluating water quality. Due to low toxicity, good electrical conductivity, facile functionalization, and easy preparation, magnetic materials have become a good alternative in recent years to control hazardous pollutants in water resources. In the present study, the idea of using magnetic sensors in controlling and monitoring of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, heavy metals, and organic pollutants have been reviewed. The water pollutants in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and seawater have been discussed. The toxicology of water hazardous pollutants has also been reviewed. Then, the magnetic materials were discussed as sensors for controlling and monitoring pollutants. Finally, future remarks and perspectives on magnetic nanosensors for controlling hazardous pollutants in water resources and environmental applications were explained.}

Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machines (SVM) are techniques that are frequently used in hydrology to specifically model streamflow. This study compares the accuracy of ANN, ANFIS, and SVM in forecasting the daily streamflow with the traditional approach known as autoregressive (AR) model for basins with different physical characteristics. The accuracies of the models are compared for three basins, that is, 1801, 1805, and 1822, at the Seyhan River Basin in Turkey. The comparison was performed by using coefficient of efficiency, index of agreement, and root-mean-square error. Results indicate that ANN and ANFIS are more accurate than AR and SVM for all the basins. ANN and ANFIS perform similarly, while ANN outperformed ANFIS. Among the models used, the ANN demonstrates the highest performance in forecasting the peak flood values. This study also finds that physical characteristics, such as small area, high slope, and high elevation variation, and streamflow variance deteriorate the accuracy of the methods.}

Accordingly, this study investigates modern non-tuned machine learning data-driven approach, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). This data-driven approach is containing single layer feedforward neural network that selects the input variables randomly and determine the output weights systematically. To demonstrate the reliability and the effectiveness, one-step-ahead stream-flow forecasting based on three time-scale pattern (daily, mean weekly and mean monthly) for Johor river, Malaysia, were implemented. Artificial neural network (ANN) model is used for comparison and evaluation. The results indicated ELM approach superior the ANN model level accuracies and time consuming in addition to precision forecasting in tropical zone. In measureable terms, the dominance of ELM model over ANN model was indicated in accordance with coefficient determination (R2) root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results were obtained for example the daily time scale R2 = 0.94 and 0.90, RMSE = 2.78 and 11.63, and MAE = 0.10 and 0.43, for ELM and ANN models respectively.}

Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.}

The proposed integrated model includes the semi-distributed forms of the Volterra and ANN models which can explore spatial variation in rainfall-runoff process without requiring physical characteristic parameters of the catchments, while taking advantage of the potential of Volterra and ANNs models in nonlinear mapping. The IVANN model was developed using hourly rainfall and runoff data pertaining to thirteen storms to study short-term responses of a forest catchment in northern Iran; and its performance was compared with that of semi-distributed integrated ANN (IANN) model and lumped Volterra model. The Volterra model was applied as a nonlinear model (second-order Volterra (SOV) model) and solved using the ordinary least square (OLS) method. The models performance were evaluated and compared using five performance criteria namely coefficient of efficiency, root mean square error, error of total volume, relative error of peak discharge and error of time for peak to arrive. Results showed that the IVANN model performs well than the other semi-distributed and lumped models to simulate the rainfall-runoff process. Comparing to the integrated models, the lumped SOV model has lower precision to simulate the rainfall-runoff process.}

For this purpose, data of daily mean streamflow of the Behesht-Abad (perennial) and Joneghan (non-perennial) rivers as well as precipitation information of 17 meteorological stations for the period 1999--2008 were used. Coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used for evaluating the applicability of developed models. This study showed that although the GEP model was the most accurate in predicting peak flows, but in overall among the four mentioned models in both perennial and non-perennial rivers, WANN had the best performance. Among input patterns, flow based and coupled precipitation-flow based patterns with negligible difference to each other were determined to be the best patterns. Also this study confirmed that combining wavelet method with ANN and GEP and developing WANN and WGEP methods results in improving the performance of ANN and GEP models.}

Although streamflow data are measured and available at most river basins, streamflow records often suffer from insufficient length or missing data. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied to extend daily streamflow records at Lilin station located in Gaoping River basin, southern Taiwan. Two ANNs, including feed forward back propagation (FFBP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks, associated with various time-lagged streamflow and rainfall inputs of nearby long-record stations are employed to extend short daily streamflow records. Performances of ANNs are evaluated by root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of efficiency (CE), and histogram-matching dissimilarity (HMD). Inconsistency among these evaluation measures is solved by the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making approach, to find an optimal model. The results indicate that RBF-E1 (entire-year data training with Qtand Qt−1 inputs) has the minimum RMSE of 104.4 m3/s, second highest CE of 0.956, and third lowest HMD of 0.0096, which outperforms other ANNs and provide the most accurate reconstruction of daily streamflow records at Lilin station.}

Hydrological time series data consists of nonlinear features and various time scales. With this view in mind, this study has combined the strengths of the Wavelet transformation, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to test a new method of a hybrid model for their ability to accurately predict future droughts. A 30-year rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2016 for Malaysia’s Langat River Basin was analyzed. Meteorological drought indices (DI) such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standard Index of Annual Precipitation (SIAP) were used to compute historical drought events. At first, each of these computed drought time series went through a process of decomposition to be divided as low frequency and high-frequency sub-series by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Secondly, the high and low-frequency sub-series were passed through the predictive model of ANN and ARIMA techniques, respectively. Lastly, the predicted sub-series were used to reconstruct and develop a final drought prediction model. It was found that the Wavelet-ARIMA-ANN (which named as W-2A) model outperformed the single ANN and wavelet-ANN predictive models. The ANN model developed by SPI achieved an overall correlation co-efficient R-value of 0.423, but the wavelet-based ANN model decreased in the R-value to 0.415. Finally, two different models, which were established using drought indices SPI and SIAP, and discrete wavelet transformation-based hybrid ANN-ARIMA (W-2A), have achieved improved R values of 0.914 and 0.934 respectively.}

The former study considered all sources of uncertainty together. In contrast, this study explores how input variable selection uncertainty and wavelet decomposition impact probabilistic forecasting performance by considering eight variations of this framework that either include/ignore wavelet decomposition and varying levels of uncertainty: 1) none; 2) parameter; 3) parameter and model output; and 4) input variable selection, parameter, and model output.

Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir.}

	ABSTRACT = {Due to the inherent non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of original streamflow and the complicated relationship between multi-scale predictors and streamflow, accurate and reliable monthly streamflow forecasting is quite difficult. In this paper, a multi-scale-variables-driven streamflow forecasting (MVDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy and provide more information for decision-making. This framework was realized by integrating random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with multi-scale variables (hydrometeorological and climate predictors) as inputs and is referred to as RF-GPR-MV. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the RF-GPR-MV model, it was implemented for multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasts with horizons of 1 to 12 months for two key hydrological stations in the Jinsha River basin, Southwest China. Other MVDSF models based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and GPR with/without multi-scale variables or the PCC and a backpropagation neural network (BP) or general regression neural network (GRNN), with only previous streamflow and precipitation, namely, PCC-GPR-MV, PCC-GPR-QP, PCC-BP-QP, and PCC-GRNN-QP, respectively, were selected as benchmarks. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model was superior to the other benchmark models in terms of the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for almost all forecasting scenarios, especially for forecasting with longer lead times. Additionally, the results also confirmed that the addition of large-scale climate and circulation factors was beneficial for promoting the streamflow forecasting ability, with an average contribution rate of about 15%. The RF in the MVDSF framework improved the forecasting performance, with an average contribution rate of about 25%. This improvement was more pronounced when the lead time exceeded 3 months. Moreover, the proposed model could also provide prediction intervals (PIs) to characterize forecast uncertainty, as supplementary information to further help decision makers in relevant departments to avoid risks in water resources management.},

	abstract = {Accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources. However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China’s Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world’s largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.}

	abstract = {Despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications, there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real-time prediction purposes. The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model’s internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ens), Willmott’s Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model’s effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by Ens = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61–22.53%) and (8.26–8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.}

Long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow forecast model has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its powerful non-linear modeling ability. But probabilistic streamflow forecasting has rarely been addressed by the LSTM approach. In this study, a probabilistic Long Short-Term Memory network coupled with the Gaussian process (GP) is proposed to deal with the probabilistic daily streamflow forecasting. Moreover, considering that changing mean and variance over time exist in the daily streamflow time series, the heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression is adopted to produce a varying prediction interval. The proposed method encapsulates the inductive biases of the LSTM recurrent network and retains the non-parametric, probabilistic property of Gaussian processes. The performance of the proposed model is investigated by predicting the daily streamflow time series collected from the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries. Artificial neuron network, generalized linear model, heteroscedastic GP, and regular LSTM models are also developed for comparison. Results indicated that the performance of the proposed model is satisfying. It improves prediction accuracy as well as provides an adaptive prediction interval, which is of great significance for water resources management and planning.},

The objective of this study is to analyze the suitability of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for modeling monthly low flows time series for three stations in Mahanadi river basin, India. The ‘low flow’ threshold was taken as the Q75 discharge, i.e., the flow is equal to or surpassed for the duration of 75% of the observation period which was obtained from the daily discharge data. The potential applicability of SVR model is assessed with two different framework models (ANN-ELM, GPR) based on various statistical measures (r2, RMSE, MAE, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, objective function (OBJ), Scatter Index (SI) and BIAS). The model selection was based on lowest OBJ value for each station amongst three models (SVR, ANN-ELM, GPR). The SVR model was trained using the Radial Basis Function (RBF). Using the same inputs, the other two models (ANN-ELM and GPR) was also tested. From results, among all the stations, the SVR outperformed GPR and ANN-ELM with lowest OBJ value for the three stations a (1.378, 1.202, 1.570). In addition, the accuracy of the three models were checked using mean forecasting error which were (0.474, 0.421, 0.509) for SVR, (0.507, 0.489 0.500) for GPR and (0.564, 0.603, 0.772) ANN-ELM for the three stations. The results confirm that SVR can be used satisfactorily for modeling monthly low flows in the Mahanadi river basin, India. Hence, the SVR model could be employed as a new reliable and accurate data intelligent approach for predicting the ‘low flow’ (Q75 discharge) based on precedent data in water resources and its allied field.},

		Streamflow forecasting plays a critical role in nearly all aspects of water resources planning and management. In this work, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), an effective kernel-based machine learning algorithm, is applied to probabilistic streamflow forecasting. GPR is built on Gaussian process, which is a stochastic process that generalizes multivariate Gaussian distribution to infinite-dimensional space such that distributions over function values can be defined. The GPR algorithm provides a tractable and flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework for inferring the posterior distribution of streamflows. The prediction skill of the algorithm is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using the MOPEX database, which includes long-term hydrometeorological time series collected from 438 basins across the U.S. from 1948 to 2003. Comparisons with linear regression and artificial neural network models indicate that GPR outperforms both regression methods in most cases. The GPR prediction of MOPEX basins is further examined using the Budyko framework, which helps to reveal the close relationships among water-energy partitions, hydrologic similarity, and predictability. Flow regime modification and the resulting loss of predictability have been a major concern in recent years because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. The persistence of streamflow predictability is thus examined by extending the original MOPEX data records to 2012. Results indicate relatively strong persistence of streamflow predictability in the extended period, although the low-predictability basins tend to show more variations. Because many low-predictability basins are located in regions experiencing fast growth of human activities, the significance of sustainable development and water resources management can be even greater for those regions.}

In recent years, artificial intelligence methods and wavelet-based hybrid models have been used for forecasting hydrological parameters. In the present study, the application of the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Wavelet-GPR models to forecast multi-step ahead daily (1–30 days ahead) reference evapotranspiration at the synoptic station of Zanjan (Iran) was investigated. For this purpose, a 10-year statistical period (2000–2009) was considered, 7 years (2000–2006) for training, and the final three years (2007–2009) for testing the various models. Various combinations of input data (various lag times) and different kinds of mother wavelets were evaluated. Results showed that, compared to the GPR model, the hybrid model Wavelet-GPR had greater ability and accuracy in forecasting daily evapotranspiration. Moreover, the use of yearly lag times in the GPR and Wavelet-GPR model increased its accuracy. The investigation of various kinds of mother wavelets also indicated that the Meyer wavelet was the most suitable mother wavelet for forecasting daily reference evapotranspiration. The results showed that by increasing the forecasting time period from 1 to 30 days, the accuracy of the models is reduced (RMSE = 0.068 mm/day for one day ahead and RMSE = 0.816 mm/day for 30 days ahead). The application of the proposed model to the summer season showed that the performance of the model during the summer season is better than its performance throughout the year.},

	abstract = {Hydrological models must be reliable and robust as these qualities influence all applications based on model output. Previous studies on conceptual rainfall–runoff models have shown that one of the root causes of their output uncertainty is model over-parameterisation. The problem of poorly defined parameters has attracted much attention but has not yet been satisfactorily solved. We believe that the most fruitful way forward is to improve the structures where these parameters act. The main objective of this paper is to examine the role of complexity in hydrological models by studying the relation between the number of optimised parameters and model performance. An extensive comparative performance assessment of the structures of 19 daily lumped models was carried out on 429 catchments, mostly in France but also in the United States, Australia, the Ivory Coast and Brazil. Bulk treatment of the data showed that the complex models outperform the simple ones in calibration mode but not in verification mode. We argue that the main reason why complex models lack stability is that the structure, i.e. the way components are organised, is not suited to extracting information available in hydrological time-series. An inadequate complexity typically results in model over-parameterisation and parameter uncertainty. Although complexity has been used as a response to the challenge of predicting the hydrological effects of environmental changes, this study suggests that such models may have been developed with excessive confidence and that they could face difficulties of parameter estimation and structure validation when confronted with hydro-meteorological time-series. This comparative study indicates that some parsimonious models can yield promising results and should be further developed, although they are not able to tackle all types of problems, which would be the case if their complexity were ideally adapted.}

This approach is demonstrated for a SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) application in a watershed in China using a calibration and two validation periods. Results show: 1) the augmented approach led to the screening out of 14–18 unimportant factors, effectively narrowing factor space; 2) compared to the more standard GLUE, it substantially improved the sampling efficiency, and located the optimal factor region at lower computational cost. This approach can be used for other uncertainty analysis techniques in hydrologic and non-hydrologic models.}

	ABSTRACT = {IMproving PRedictions and management of hydrological EXtremes (IMPREX) was a European Union Horizon 2020 project that ran from September 2015 to September 2019. IMPREX aimed to improve society’s ability to anticipate and respond to future extreme hydrological events in Europe across a variety of uses in the water-related sectors (flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, agriculture, navigation, hydropower and water supply utilities). Through the engagement with stakeholders and continuous feedback between model outputs and water applications, progress was achieved in better understanding the way hydrological predictions can be useful to (and operationally incorporated into) problem-solving in the water sector. The work and discussions carried out during the project nurtured further reflections toward a common vision for hydrological prediction. In this article, we summarized the main findings of the IMPREX project within a broader overview of hydrological prediction, providing a vision for improving such predictions. In so doing, we first presented a synopsis of hydrological and weather forecasting, with a focus on medium-range to seasonal scales of prediction for increased preparedness. Second, the lessons learned from IMPREX were discussed. The key findings were the gaps highlighted in the global observing system of the hydrological cycle, the degree of accuracy of hydrological models and the techniques of post-processing to correct biases, the origin of seasonal hydrological skill in Europe and user requirements of hydrometeorological forecasts to ensure their appropriate use in decision-making models and practices. Last, a vision for how to improve these forecast systems/products in the future was expounded, including advancing numerical weather and hydrological models, improved earth monitoring and more frequent interaction between forecasters and users to tailor the forecasts to applications. We conclude that if these improvements can be implemented in the coming years, earth system and hydrological modelling will become more skillful, thus leading to socioeconomic benefits for the citizens of Europe and beyond.},

We compared two ML models, RNN and LSTM, to the conceptual hydrological model Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) within the low-land Ems catchment in Germany. Furthermore, we implemented a simple routing routine in the ML models and used simulated upstream streamflow as forcing data to test whether the individual model errors accumulate. The ML models have a superior model performance compared to the HBV model for a wide range of statistical performance indices. Yet, the ML models show a performance decline for low-flows in two of the sub-catchments. Signature indices sampling the flow duration curve reveal that the ML models in our study provide a good representation of the water balance, whereas the HBV model instead has its strength in the reproduction of streamflow dynamics. Regarding the applied routing routine in the ML models, there are no strong indications of an increasing error rising upstream to downstream throughout the sub-catchments.},
