\section{What is a Foundation Model?}

\begin{frame}{Foundation Models}
    Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models trained on vast amounts of data across various domains and modalities. They can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks with relatively small-labeled datasets.

    That is, learn general representations during pre-training that can be transferred to various specific tasks during fine-tuning.

\begin{frame}{Breaking Down Foundation Models: Pre-training}
    The model is trained on a large and diverse dataset using self-supervised learning techniques. This allows the model to learn general features and patterns from the data.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Breaking Down Foundation Models: Fine-tuning}
    The pre-trained model is then adapted to specific tasks using smaller labeled datasets. This process leverages the knowledge acquired during pre-training to improve performance on the target task.
