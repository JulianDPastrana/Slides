\section{What is a Foundation Model?}

\begin{frame}{Foundation Models}
    Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models trained on vast amounts of data across various domains and modalities, called pre-training step. They can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks with relatively small-labeled datasets, called fine-tuning step.

    That is, learn general representations during pre-training that can be transferred to various specific tasks during fine-tuning.
