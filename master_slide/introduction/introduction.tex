	Understanding hydrological processes has become increasingly critical in the field of natural resource management, anticipation capacity of extreme hydrological events such as droughts and heavy rainfall.

\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Physically driven models for water resource forecasting are complex and require extensive parameter knowledge, limiting their practicality \cite{Yaseen2018, HKASHANI2016340}.
		\item Data-driven models, such as autoregressive (AR) models, struggle to capture nonlinearities in water resources time series \cite{10.2166/wst.2020.369}.
		\item Neural networks (ANNs, RNNs) improve on nonlinearity, but face overfitting, gradient vanishing and exploding, limiting ability to capture long-term dependencies \cite{Abdollahi2017, Shiau2016, KHAN2020125380}.
		\item LSTM networks overcome these issues, but lack uncertainty quantification, crucial for decision-making in hydrological forecasting \cite{lakshminarayanan2017simple, gal2016dropout}.
		\item Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide uncertainty and handle nonlinearities, but scaling to multi-task forecasting remains a challenge \cite{QUILTY2020104718, NIU2021102562,bruinsma2020scalable}.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop a model that allows the forecasting of hydrological time series, properly quantifying the uncertainty associated with each value within the prediction horizons.
		\item  Design a multi-task forecasting methodology that captures and models cross-correlations between hydrological time series, to improve forecast accuracy within forecast horizons.
		\item Develop a multi-task prediction methodology that handles data constraints across reservoirs while maintaining high forecasting performance as measured by probabilistic metrics.
	\end{itemize}

\section{The Dataset}

\begin{frame}{Problem Setting}
	We model hydrological time series using observed resource vectors. At each time step \( n \), the vector \(\mathbf{v}_n \in \mathbb{R}^D\) represents resources across \(D\) outputs.
	
	The input vector \(\mathbf{x}_n\) for the model is constructed from the resource vectors from time \( n \) back to \( n-T+1 \):
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{x}_n = \begin{bmatrix} 
			\mathbf{v}_{n}^\top \\ 
			\mathbf{v}_{n-1}^\top \\ 
			\vdots \\ 
			\mathbf{v}_{n-T+1}^\top 
		\end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{X}
	\end{equation*}
	
	Here, \( T \) is the model order and \( H \) is the prediction horizon and \( \mathcal{X}\subset \mathbb{R}^{DT} \) represents the input space.
	
	\vspace{10pt}
	
	The target output vector \(\mathbf{y}_n\) is:
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{y}_n = \mathbf{v}_{n+H} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}
	\end{equation*}
	
	We build a dataset \(\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{y}_n\}_{n=1}^N  = \{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}\}\), comprising \( N \) input-output pairs.
