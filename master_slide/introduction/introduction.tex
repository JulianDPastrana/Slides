\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	
	Understanding the implications of time series associated with hydrological variables, such as flow rates or reservoir levels, is essential for hydroelectric generation and the planning of other generation systems in Colombia

\begin{frame}{The Proposed Model}
	A Gaussian Process (GP) is a Bayesian non-parametric model that provides not just point predictions but a full probability distribution, capturing uncertainty and enabling confidence intervals in time series forecasting.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{frame}{Objectives}
	\textbf{General Objective:} \\
	Develop a stochastic forecasting model for making multiple simultaneous predictions of hydrological time series. This model will take advantage of cross-correlations among the tasks to improve performance, while maintaining scalability for short-term horizons.

	\textbf{Specific Objectives:}
	\justifying
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop a model that allows the forecasting of hydrological time series, properly quantifying the uncertainty associated with each value within the prediction horizons.
		\item  Design a multi-task forecasting methodology that captures and models cross-correlations between hydrological time series, to improve forecast accuracy within forecast horizons.
		\item Develop a multi-task prediction methodology that handles data constraints across reservoirs while maintaining high forecasting performance as measured by probabilistic metrics.
	\end{itemize}

\section{The Dataset}

\begin{frame}{Problem Setting}
	We model hydrological time series using observed resource vectors. At each time step \( n \), the vector \(\mathbf{v}_n \in \mathbb{R}^D\) represents resources across \(D\) outputs.
	
	The input vector \(\mathbf{x}_n\) for the model is constructed from the resource vectors from time \( n \) back to \( n-T+1 \):
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{x}_n = \begin{bmatrix} 
			\mathbf{v}_{n}^\top \\ 
			\mathbf{v}_{n-1}^\top \\ 
			\vdots \\ 
			\mathbf{v}_{n-T+1}^\top 
		\end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{X}
	\end{equation*}
	
	Here, \( T \) is the model order and \( H \) is the prediction horizon and \( \mathcal{X}\subset \mathbb{R}^{DT} \) represents the input space.
	
	\vspace{10pt}
	
	The target output vector \(\mathbf{y}_n\) is:
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathbf{y}_n = \mathbf{v}_{n+H} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}
	\end{equation*}
	
	We build a dataset \(\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{x}_n, \mathbf{y}_n\}_{n=1}^N  = \{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}\}\), comprising \( N \) input-output pairs.

\begin{frame}{Dataset Overview}
	The dataset was chosen due to the significant impact of weather patterns on time-series data, which are crucial for hydropower dispatch operations.

	Streamflow contributions were recorded daily from January 1, 2010, to February 28, 2022. Although these values represent volumetric measurements, they are reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh) by the hydroelectric power plants.
