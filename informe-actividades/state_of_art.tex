%%%%% Emotion detencton form wearable devices

Wearable devices allows to measure physiological biomarkers in a non-intrusive fashion. The collected data may correlate with stress levels, emotion states and biological responses. Those measurement often include Hear Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (ADA), Heart Rate (HRl) and three axis acceleration (ACC) \cite{Vos2023}. Advance in machine learning techniques have allowed to construct models that predict sentimental state based on recorded biomarkers.
