	abstract = {Prevalent mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, commonly manifest in students throughout the transition to early adulthood. Mental illnesses can significantly impact students’ academic and social activities. An automatic or semiautomatic health monitoring approach is very effective for diagnosing depression and anxiety. This study aims to implement and scrutinize a data-driven optimization method for identifying and providing therapy to students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The proposed method starts with data preprocessing and operating sentiment analysis to identify mentally disordered students. An ensemble learning classifier later divides students with symptoms into three categories based on their health condition: severe, moderate, and mild. A hyperparameter optimization approach is further adopted to improve the model's performance. Finally, a rule-based dispatching system is implemented for scheduling therapy sessions. The proposed novel data-driven method is a post-disaster intelligent and reliable method that integrates three well-adopted techniques to address students’ depression and anxiety. The findings indicate that the conventional approach to monitoring depression among students previously detected only 7 to 15% of cases. However, the performance of the offered strategy revealed a confirmed rate of 44% of depressed and anxious students.},

A set of salient features were selected independently using minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) and ensemble feature selection (EFS) methods. Decision models were trained using five well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), radial-based SVM (RBSVM), and Random Forest. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using accuracy, recall, and specificity with ten runs of a ten-fold cross-validation scheme. We run seven experiments by considering different combinations of features. The maximum classification accuracy of 75% was obtained with CT and PC features with RBSVM and SVM with the EFS. An increase in GM volume in fifteen brain regions and loss of cortical thickness in twenty-seven brain regions were observed.}

abstract = {Background:
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person’s sleep, mood, anxiety, and learning. Early diagnosis and timely medication can help individuals with ADHD perform daily tasks without difficulty. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can help neurologists to detect ADHD by examining the changes occurring in it. The EEG signals are complex, non-linear, and non-stationary. It is difficult to find the subtle differences between ADHD and healthy control EEG signals visually. Also, making decisions from existing machine learning (ML) models do not guarantee similar performance (unreliable).
Method:
The paper explores a combination of variational mode decomposition (VMD), and Hilbert transform (HT) called VMD-HT to extract hidden information from EEG signals. Forty-one statistical parameters extracted from the absolute value of analytical mode functions (AMF) have been classified using the explainable boosted machine (EBM) model. The interpretability of the model is tested using statistical analysis and performance measurement. The importance of the features, channels and brain regions has been identified using the glass-box and black-box approach. The model’s local and global explainability has been visualized using Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), and Morris sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the explainability of the model prediction in ADHD detection, particularly for children.
Results:
Our results show that the explainable model has provided an accuracy of 99.81%, a sensitivity of 99.78%, 99.84% specificity, an F-1 measure of 99.83%, the precision of 99.87%, a false detection rate of 0.13%, and Mathew’s correlation coefficient, negative predicted value, and critical success index of 99.61%, 99.73%, and 99.66%, respectively in detecting the ADHD automatically with ten-fold cross-validation. The model has provided an area under the curve of 100% while the detection rate of 99.87% and 99.73% has been obtained for ADHD and HC, respectively.
Conclusions:
The model show that the interpretability and explainability of frontal region is highest compared to pre-frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal regions. Our findings has provided important insight into the developed model which is highly reliable, robust, interpretable, and explainable for the clinicians to detect ADHD in children. Early and rapid ADHD diagnosis using robust explainable technologies may reduce the cost of treatment and lessen the number of patients undergoing lengthy diagnosis procedures.}

abstract={Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder in children that can persist into adulthood if not treated. Early diagnosis of this condition is crucial for effective treatment. The database includes 61 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 60 healthy children as a control group. To diagnose children with ADHD, features were first extracted from EEG signals. Next, a convolutional neural network model was trained, and a new residual network was introduced. The two proposed models were evaluated using tenfold cross-validation on the test data. The average accuracy and F1 score were 92.52{\%} and 93.6{\%}, respectively, for the convolutional model and 96.8{\%} and 97.1{\%} for the ResNet model on the epoch data, respectively. On the other hand, accuracy for subject-based prediction was 96.5{\%} for the convolution model and 98.6{\%} for the modified ResNet model. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the proposed ResNet model are better than the convolution model proposed in previous studies and better than the proposed model in the literature. This work presents a paradigm shift in the cognitive-inspired domain by introducing a novel ResNet model for ADHD diagnosis. The model's exceptional accuracy, exceeding conventional methods, showcases its potential as a biologically inspired tool. This opens avenues for exploring the neurological underpinnings of ADHD because the model can be used for the manifold learning of EEG signals. Analyzing the proposed network can lead to a deeper understanding of EEG, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience. The paper's innovative approach has far-reaching implications, offering a concrete application of cognitive principles to improve mental health diagnostics in children. It is important to note that the data were augmented and the classification model is based on a single experiment containing a very small number of children but the results, and accuracy of classification, are based on classifying augmented data samples that compose the EEG signals of this small number of individuals. It is prudent to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of these models across a broad cohort of subjects.},

ABSTRACT = {Combating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety has become a global concern. As a result of the necessity for finding effective ways to battle these problems, machine learning approaches have been included in healthcare systems for the diagnosis and probable prediction of the treatment outcomes of mental health conditions. With the growing interest in machine and deep learning methods, analysis of existing work to guide future research directions is necessary. In this study, 33 articles on the diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anorexia nervosa, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were retrieved from various search databases using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) review methodology. These publications were chosen based on their use of machine learning and deep learning technologies, individually assessed, and their recommended methodologies were then classified into the various disorders included in this study. In addition, the difficulties encountered by the researchers are discussed, and a list of some public datasets is provided.},

abstract={Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous disorder with a high degree of psychiatric and physical comorbidity, which complicates its diagnosis in childhood and adolescence. We analyzed registry data from 238,696 persons born and living in Sweden between 1995 and 1999. Several machine learning techniques were used to assess the ability of registry data to inform the diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and adolescence: logistic regression, random Forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, penalized logistic regression, deep neural network (DNN), and ensemble models. The best fitting model was the DNN, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75, 95{\%} CI (0.74--0.76) and balanced accuracy of 0.69. At the 0.45 probability threshold, sensitivity was 71.66{\%} and specificity was 65.0{\%}. There was an overall agreement in the feature importance among all models ($\tau${\thinspace}>{\thinspace}.5). The top 5 features contributing to classification were having a parent with criminal convictions, male sex, having a relative with ADHD, number of academic subjects failed, and speech/learning disabilities. A DNN model predicting childhood and adolescent ADHD trained exclusively on Swedish register data achieved good discrimination. If replicated and validated in an external sample, and proven to be cost-effective, this model could be used to alert clinicians to individuals who ought to be screened for ADHD and to aid clinicians' decision-making with the goal of decreasing misdiagnoses. Further research is needed to validate results in different populations and to incorporate new predictors.},

abstract={In this study, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder, is being studied alongside its comorbidity, conduct disorder (CD), a behavioral disorder. Because ADHD and CD share commonalities, distinguishing them is difficult, thus increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is crucial that these two conditions are not mistakenly identified as the same because the treatment plan varies depending on whether the patient has CD or ADHD. Hence, this study proposes an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based deep learning system known as ADHD/CD-NET that is capable of objectively distinguishing ADHD, ADHD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}CD, and CD. The 12-channel EEG signals were first segmented and converted into channel-wise continuous wavelet transform (CWT) correlation matrices. The resulting matrices were then used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the model's performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was also used to provide explanations for the prediction result made by the `black box' CNN model. Internal private dataset (45 ADHD, 62 ADHD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}CD and 16 CD) and external public dataset (61 ADHD and 60 healthy controls) were used to evaluate ADHD/CD-NET. As a result, ADHD/CD-NET achieved classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 93.70{\%}, 90.83{\%}, 95.35{\%} and 91.85{\%} for the internal evaluation, and 98.19{\%}, 98.36{\%}, 98.03{\%} and 98.06{\%} for the external evaluation. Grad-CAM also identified significant channels that contributed to the diagnosis outcome. Therefore, ADHD/CD-NET can perform temporal localization and choose significant EEG channels for diagnosis, thus providing objective analysis for mental health professionals and clinicians to consider when making a diagnosis.},

Recent innovations of the stethoscope have enabled the simultaneous acquisition of a high-quality digital acoustic signal and ECG. We present foundation models trained on phonocardiogram (PCG) and ECG data collected from digital stethoscopes during routine clinical practice. We show that these foundation models that are pre-trained on large unlabeled datasets in a self-supervised manner can be fine-tuned for a variety of cardiovascular disease detection tasks. This is the first study that builds foundation models specifically for synchronously captured PCG and ECG data. Our approach is based on the recently developed masked autoencoder framework which we extend to handle multiple signals that are synchronously captured. This paradigm makes it possible to use large capacity models leading to superior performance even though the size of datasets with medical label annotations may be limited.},

abstract = {Tracking biosignals is crucial for monitoring wellness and preempting the development of severe medical conditions. Today, wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals, creating the opportunity to monitor health status without disruption to one's daily routine. Despite widespread use of wearable devices and existing digital biomarkers, the absence of curated data with annotated medical labels hinders the development of new biomarkers to measure common health conditions. In fact, medical datasets are usually small in comparison to other domains, which is an obstacle for developing neural network models for biosignals. To address this challenge, we have employed self-supervised learning using the unlabeled sensor data collected under informed consent from the large longitudinal Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) to train foundation models for two common biosignals: photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded on Apple Watch. We curated PPG and ECG datasets from AHMS that include data from ~141K participants spanning ~3 years. Our self-supervised learning framework includes participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation module and a regularized contrastive loss optimized with momentum training, and generalizes well to both PPG and ECG modalities. We show that the pre-trained foundation models readily encode information regarding participants' demographics and health conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that builds foundation models using large-scale PPG and ECG data collected via wearable consumer devices $\unicode\{x2013\}$ prior works have commonly used smaller-size datasets collected in clinical and experimental settings. We believe PPG and ECG foundation models can enhance future wearable devices by reducing the reliance on labeled data and hold the potential to help the users improve their health.},

abstract = {Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease to highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges. We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally, we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.}

abstract={Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder in children that can persist into adulthood if not treated. Early diagnosis of this condition is crucial for effective treatment. The database includes 61 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 60 healthy children as a control group. To diagnose children with ADHD, features were first extracted from EEG signals. Next, a convolutional neural network model was trained, and a new residual network was introduced. The two proposed models were evaluated using tenfold cross-validation on the test data. The average accuracy and F1 score were 92.52{\%} and 93.6{\%}, respectively, for the convolutional model and 96.8{\%} and 97.1{\%} for the ResNet model on the epoch data, respectively. On the other hand, accuracy for subject-based prediction was 96.5{\%} for the convolution model and 98.6{\%} for the modified ResNet model. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the proposed ResNet model are better than the convolution model proposed in previous studies and better than the proposed model in the literature. This work presents a paradigm shift in the cognitive-inspired domain by introducing a novel ResNet model for ADHD diagnosis. The model's exceptional accuracy, exceeding conventional methods, showcases its potential as a biologically inspired tool. This opens avenues for exploring the neurological underpinnings of ADHD because the model can be used for the manifold learning of EEG signals. Analyzing the proposed network can lead to a deeper understanding of EEG, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience. The paper's innovative approach has far-reaching implications, offering a concrete application of cognitive principles to improve mental health diagnostics in children. It is important to note that the data were augmented and the classification model is based on a single experiment containing a very small number of children but the results, and accuracy of classification, are based on classifying augmented data samples that compose the EEG signals of this small number of individuals. It is prudent to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of these models across a broad cohort of subjects.},

abstract = {A systematic review on machine-learning strategies for improving generalization in electroencephalography-based emotion classification was realized. In particular, cross-subject and cross-session generalization was focused. In this context, the non-stationarity of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is a critical issue and can lead to the Dataset Shift problem. Several architectures and methods have been proposed to address this issue, mainly based on transfer learning methods. In this review, 449 papers were retrieved from the Scopus, IEEE Xplore and PubMed databases through a search query focusing on modern machine learning techniques for generalization in EEG-based emotion assessment. Among these papers, 79 were found eligible based on their relevance to the problem. Studies lacking a specific cross-subject or cross-session validation strategy, or making use of other biosignals as support were excluded. On the basis of the selected papers’ analysis, a taxonomy of the studies employing Machine Learning (ML) methods was proposed, together with a brief discussion of the different ML approaches involved. The studies reporting the best results in terms of average classification accuracy were identified, supporting that transfer learning methods seem to perform better than other approaches. A discussion is proposed on the impact of (i) the emotion theoretical models and (ii) psychological screening of the experimental sample on the classifier performances.}

abstract="Despite arising in childhood, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can persist into adulthood, compromising the individual's social skills. ADHD diagnosis is a real challenge due to its dependence on the clinical observation of the patient, the information provided by parents and teachers, and the clinicians' expertise. Therefore, there is great interest in studying objective biomarkers extracted from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals supporting accurate diagnoses. However, the non-stationarity and non-linearity characteristics of the EEG hinders the development of such tools. This paper presents a methodology for supporting the ADHD diagnosis by extracting features from the Discrete Wavelet transform of EEG signals. Due to the failed inhibitory control symptom, we consider EEG signals recorded under the Reward Stop Signal Task paradigm. Then, the logistic regressor learns the linear boundary discriminating between ADHD and healthy control subjects. As a benefit, the weighting vector supporting the classification also provides a straightforward interpretation of features in spatial locations and decomposition levels. The cross-validated classification results prove that the approach reaches an F1 score of {\$}{\$}96{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}96{\%}on a dataset of 34 children. Besides, the interpretability results support the hypothesis that the motivational effect leads the poor impulse control in ADHD.",

abstract = {Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a ubiquitous neurodevelopmental disorder affecting many children. Therefore, automated diagnosis of ADHD can be of tremendous value. Unfortunately, unlike many other applications, the use of deep learning algorithms for automatic detection of ADHD is still limited.
Method
In this paper, we proposed a novel computer aided diagnosis system based on deep learning approach to classify the EEG signal of Healthy children (Control) from ADHD children with two subtypes of Combined ADHD (ADHD-C) and Inattentive ADHD (ADHD-I). Inspired by the classical approaches, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network that is capable of extracting both spatial and frequency band features from the raw electroencephalograph (EEG) signal and then performing the classification.
Result
We achieved the highest classification accuracy with the combination of β1, β2, and γ bands. Accuracy Recall, Precision, and Kappa values were %99.46, %99.45, %99.48, and 0.99, respectively. After investigating the spatial channels, we observed that electrodes in the Posterior side had the most contribution.
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, all previous multiclass studies were based on fMRI and MRI imaging. Therefore, the presented research is novel in terms of using a deep neural network architecture and EEG signal for multiclass classification of ADHD and healthy children with high accuracy.}
