	abstract = {Prevalent mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, commonly manifest in students throughout the transition to early adulthood. Mental illnesses can significantly impact students’ academic and social activities. An automatic or semiautomatic health monitoring approach is very effective for diagnosing depression and anxiety. This study aims to implement and scrutinize a data-driven optimization method for identifying and providing therapy to students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The proposed method starts with data preprocessing and operating sentiment analysis to identify mentally disordered students. An ensemble learning classifier later divides students with symptoms into three categories based on their health condition: severe, moderate, and mild. A hyperparameter optimization approach is further adopted to improve the model's performance. Finally, a rule-based dispatching system is implemented for scheduling therapy sessions. The proposed novel data-driven method is a post-disaster intelligent and reliable method that integrates three well-adopted techniques to address students’ depression and anxiety. The findings indicate that the conventional approach to monitoring depression among students previously detected only 7 to 15% of cases. However, the performance of the offered strategy revealed a confirmed rate of 44% of depressed and anxious students.},

The present study emphasises utilizing structural MRI and personal characteristic (PC) data for developing an automated diagnostic system for ADHD classification. Here, an age-balanced dataset of 316 ADHD and 316 Typically Developing Children (TDC) was prepared from the publicly available dataset. We extracted volumetric features from gray matter (GM) volumes from brain regions defined by Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL3) atlas and cortical thickness-based (CT) features using the Destrieux atlas. A set of salient features were selected independently using minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) and ensemble feature selection (EFS) methods. Decision models were trained using five well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), radial-based SVM (RBSVM), and Random Forest. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using accuracy, recall, and specificity with ten runs of a ten-fold cross-validation scheme. We run seven experiments by considering different combinations of features. The maximum classification accuracy of 75% was obtained with CT and PC features with RBSVM and SVM with the EFS. An increase in GM volume in fifteen brain regions and loss of cortical thickness in twenty-seven brain regions were observed.}
