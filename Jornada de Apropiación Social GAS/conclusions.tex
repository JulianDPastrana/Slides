\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A computational tool was developed for \emph{long-term planning} of Colombia’s natural gas transportation system.  
		\item \emph{Gaussian Process models} provided efficient forecasts of thermoelectric gas demand under climatic variability.  
		\item An optimization framework with \emph{MPCC formulation} addressed nonlinear pipeline constraints, reducing computational burden.  
		\item The tool enables evaluation of \emph{investment alternatives}, balancing reliability and cost under operational uncertainty.  
	\end{itemize}
