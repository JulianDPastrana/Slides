\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A computational tool integrates \emph{prediction} and \emph{optimization} for Colombia’s gas system under uncertainty.
		\item Gaussian Process models with \emph{compact inducing sets} provide efficient and expressive demand forecasts.
		\item The optimization framework incorporates \emph{physical and economic constraints} with an \emph{MPCC formulation} for pipeline flows.
		\item The tool supports \emph{long-term planning}, evaluating expansions and trade-offs between \emph{reliability} and \emph{cost}.
