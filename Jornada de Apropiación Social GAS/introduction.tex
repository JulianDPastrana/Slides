\section{The Importance of Natural Gas Network}
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
	Natural gas has become one of the most important energy sources worldwide. Moreover, long-term planning must also account for external factors such as climatic behavior, planning of new elements, and avoid shortage scenario.

	\begin{block}{Challenges}
		High dispatch uncertainty, operational costs, and  integration of new injection sources.

\begin{frame}{General Objective}
	Develop a tool for the optimal long-term planning of the operation of the
	Colombian natural gas transportation system. The tool should enable the
	evaluation of multiple investment scenarios by considering the existing
	infrastructure, uncertainties in supply and demand, and the impact of
	diverse climatic conditions, while ensuring the efficient use of thermal
	and electrical energy.

\begin{frame}{Specific Objectives}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Develop a methodology for predicting the dispatch of thermoelectric
		generation plants based on historical information provided by the grid
		operator. This methodology should establish the average natural gas
		demand of each plant for every period considered within the planning
		horizon.
		\item Design a stochastic and/or exact optimization strategy that identifies
		a set of alternatives and their respective execution periods for the
		long-term planning of the Colombian natural gas transportation network.
		The strategy should minimize both operational and investment costs,
		taking into account the current system infrastructure and the developed
		prediction models.
		\item Implement a long-term planning tool for the Colombian natural gas
		transportation network based on the developed optimization strategy
		and predictive models.
