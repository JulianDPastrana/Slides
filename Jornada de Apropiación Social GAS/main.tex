\begin{frame}{General Objective}
	\begin{block}{}
		Develop a tool for the optimal long-term planning of the operation of Colombia's natural gas transportation system that allows for the evaluation of multiple investment scenarios, taking into account existing infrastructure, uncertainty in supply and demand, and the effect of various climate scenarios, making efficient use of thermal and electrical energy.

\begin{frame}{Specific Objectives}
	\begin{block}{}
		\small
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Develop a foundational model for the classification of biological signals related to EEG recordings, leveraging \textcolor{MyAccent}{unlabeled data} during the self-learning phase and labeled data for fine-tuning.
			\item Implement a \textcolor{MyAccent}{stochastic prediction} tool based on Gaussian processes to model uncertainty in the foundational model's predictions.
			\item Design a strategy to \textcolor{MyAccent}{manage variability and inconsistency} in EEG recording datasets, enabling the effective integration of databases with diverse standards.
