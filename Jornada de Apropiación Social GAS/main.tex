\begin{frame}{General Objective}
	\begin{block}{}
		Develop a tool for the optimal long-term planning of the operation of Colombia's natural gas transportation system that allows for the evaluation of multiple investment scenarios, taking into account existing infrastructure, uncertainty in supply and demand, and the effect of various climate scenarios, making efficient use of thermal and electrical energy.
	\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Specific Objectives}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Develop a methodology for predicting the dispatch of thermoelectric power plants based on historical information provided by the grid operator, which allows establishing the average natural gas demand value for each plant for each of the periods to be considered within the planning horizon.
			
			\item Implement a \textcolor{MyAccent}{stochastic prediction} tool based on Gaussian processes to model uncertainty in the foundational model's predictions.
			\item Design a strategy to \textcolor{MyAccent}{manage variability and inconsistency} in EEG recording datasets, enabling the effective integration of databases with diverse standards.
