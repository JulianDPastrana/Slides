\begin{frame}{Nodes}
	A node represents an interconnection point of different elements of the gas network where their flows converge.

			\item $f_{iny}$: Injected flow.
			\item $f_{dem}$: Demanded flow.
			\item $f_{rest}$: Equivalent restoration flow of unmet demand.
			\item $f_{N}$: Flow within the network (net flow).

\begin{frame}{Pipelines}
	Pipelines are the physical infrastructure through which gas is transported. They are characterized by the pair of nodes they connect and by their gas transport capacities.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item [$f_{i,j}$] Flow transported through the pipeline.
		\item [$p_{i}$] Pressure at the suction node.
		\item [$p_{j}$] Pressure at the discharge node.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Compressors}
	Compressors, like pipelines, are elements that interconnect pairs of nodes and transport a flow of gas. Their role in the system is to increase the pressure at the discharge node relative to the suction node in order to transport gas over longer distances and compensate for pressure losses due to friction in the pipelines.
