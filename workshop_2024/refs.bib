	abstract = {Prevalent mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, commonly manifest in students throughout the transition to early adulthood. Mental illnesses can significantly impact students’ academic and social activities. An automatic or semiautomatic health monitoring approach is very effective for diagnosing depression and anxiety. This study aims to implement and scrutinize a data-driven optimization method for identifying and providing therapy to students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The proposed method starts with data preprocessing and operating sentiment analysis to identify mentally disordered students. An ensemble learning classifier later divides students with symptoms into three categories based on their health condition: severe, moderate, and mild. A hyperparameter optimization approach is further adopted to improve the model’s performance. Finally, a rule-based dispatching system is implemented for scheduling therapy sessions. The proposed novel data-driven method is a post-disaster intelligent and reliable method that integrates three well-adopted techniques to address students’ depression and anxiety. The findings indicate that the conventional approach to monitoring depression among students previously detected only 7 to 15% of cases. However, the performance of the offered strategy revealed a confirmed rate of 44% of depressed and anxious students.}

We further examined the extent to which ERP variables (2) predict, in the ADHD subsample, substance use (i) concurrently and (ii) prospectively at 18-month follow-up. Linear support vector machine analyses indicated ERPs weakly differentiate youth with/without (65%) – and at-risk for/not at-risk for (63%) – ADHD but better differentiate ADHD presentations (78%). Regression analyses showed in adolescents with ADHD, ERPs explain a considerable proportion of variance (50%) in concurrent alcohol use and, controlling for concurrent marijuana and tobacco use, explain a considerable proportion of variance (87 and 87%) in, and predict later marijuana and tobacco use. Findings are consistent with the dual-pathway model of ADHD. Results also highlight limitations of a dichotomous, syndromic classification and indicate differences in neural reinforcement sensitivity are a promising ADHD prognostic biomarker.}

	abstract = {Abstract College student mental health has been a critical concern for professional counselors. Anxiety and depressive disorders have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. Utilizing machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), we developed predictive models (i.e., eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost], Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) to identify US college students at heightened risk of diagnosable anxiety and depressive disorders. The dataset included 61,619 students from 133 US higher education institutions and was partitioned into a 90:10 ratio for training and testing the models. We employed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance and examined multiple measures of predictive performance (e.g., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], accuracy, sensitivity). Results revealed strong discriminative power in our machine learning predictive models with AUC of 0.74 and 0.77, indicating current financial situation, sense of belonging on campus, disability status, and age as the top predictors of anxiety and depressive disorders. This study provides a practical tool for professional counselors to proactively identify students for anxiety and depressive disorders before these conditions escalate. Application of machine learning in counseling research provides data-driven insights that help enhance the understanding of mental health determinants, guide prevention and intervention strategies, and promote the well-being of diverse student populations through counseling.}

	abstract = {Background
	Mental disorders (MDs) are becoming a leading burden in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). As per the World Health Organization's 2022 assessment report, there was a steep increase of 25 % in MDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis of MDs can significantly improve treatment outcome and save disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In recent times, the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)) has shown promising results in the diagnosis of MDs, and the field has witnessed a huge research output in the form of research publications. Therefore, a bibliometric mapping along with a review of recent advancements is required.
	Methods
	This study presents a bibliometric analysis and review of the research, published over the last 10 years. Literature searches were conducted in the Scopus database for the period from January 1, 2012, to June 9, 2023. The data was filtered and screened to include only relevant and reliable publications. A total of 2811 journal articles were found. The data was exported to a comma-separated value (CSV) format for further analysis. Furthermore, a review of 40 selected studies was performed.
	Results
	The popularity of ML techniques in diagnosing MDs has been growing, with an annual research growth rate of 17.05 %. The Journal of Affective Disorders published the most documents (n = 97), while Wang Y. (n = 64) has published the most articles. Lotka's law is observed, with a minority of authors contributing the majority of publications. The top affiliating institutes are the West China Hospital of Sichuan University followed by the University of California, with China and the US dominating the top 10 institutes. While China has more publications, papers affiliated with the US receive more citations. Depression and schizophrenia are the primary focuses of ML and deep learning (DL) in mental disease detection. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that ML is associated with depression, schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and PTSD. Popular algorithms include support vector machine (SVM) classifier, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier. Furthermore, DL is linked to neuroimaging techniques such as MRI, fMRI, and EEG, as well as bipolar disorder. Current research trends encompass DL, LSTM, generalized anxiety disorder, feature fusion, and convolutional neural networks.}

Here, we argue that without coordinated action on the social determinants of health, it is difficult to envisage meaningful progress on preventing mental disorders at a population level. We highlight the importance and opportunity of a developmental life course approach to the prevention of mental disorders. This approach recognises that upstream, distal factors that occur early in life act as fundamental causes of mental health, and that varying targets and interventions may be needed at different stages across the lifespan. We draw on a well-established framework for disease prevention – immunisation schedules – to embed action on social determinants of health into a national framework for the prevention of mental disorders. We call for a substantial shift to meaningful, multi-disciplinary co-production with policymakers across sectors, educators, researchers, clinicians, minorities, First Nations groups, people with lived experience and young people, to produce widespread, sustainable solutions to preventing mental disorders.}

	abstract = {Background
	: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a prevalent mental health illness with a direct impact on patient's well-being. Self-report-based BD screening questionnaires such as the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is economical and clinically validated. We use a machine-learning approach to test whether utilizing our composite screening application - EarlyDetect (ED), designed for assessing an array of mental health illness, can enhance bipolar disorder screening over MDQ.
	Methods
	: This was a retrospective, naturalistic study at a tertiary mental health centre in western Canada. Participants (n = 955; 56.4% female; mean age 35.4; 18.7% BD) completed ED and underwent a clinical interview with a blinded psychiatrist for diagnostic accuracy. Elastic net and leave-one-out cross-validation was used to make more confident predictions at an individual level.
	Results
	: Using composite scoring, the balanced accuracy of our tool was 80.6%, with a sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 87.5%. Compared with the MDQ original scoring method, the fully composite ED model improved balanced accuracy by 6.9%, sensitivity by 14.5%, while maintaining specificity.
	Limitations
	: Patients were assessed using clinical psychiatric evaluations, which are subjective. There is also the potential for self-reporting bias. BD subtypes were not differentiated. The cross-sectional design of this study rules out conclusions of causality.
	Conclusions
	: Our results show improved BD detection accuracy using composite measures.}
