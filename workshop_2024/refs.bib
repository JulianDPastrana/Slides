	abstract = {Prevalent mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, commonly manifest in students throughout the transition to early adulthood. Mental illnesses can significantly impact students’ academic and social activities. An automatic or semiautomatic health monitoring approach is very effective for diagnosing depression and anxiety. This study aims to implement and scrutinize a data-driven optimization method for identifying and providing therapy to students with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The proposed method starts with data preprocessing and operating sentiment analysis to identify mentally disordered students. An ensemble learning classifier later divides students with symptoms into three categories based on their health condition: severe, moderate, and mild. A hyperparameter optimization approach is further adopted to improve the model’s performance. Finally, a rule-based dispatching system is implemented for scheduling therapy sessions. The proposed novel data-driven method is a post-disaster intelligent and reliable method that integrates three well-adopted techniques to address students’ depression and anxiety. The findings indicate that the conventional approach to monitoring depression among students previously detected only 7 to 15% of cases. However, the performance of the offered strategy revealed a confirmed rate of 44% of depressed and anxious students.}

	abstract = {We evaluated event-related potential (ERP) indices of reinforcement sensitivity as ADHD biomarkers by examining, in N=306 adolescents (Mage=15.78, SD=1.08), the extent to which ERP amplitude and latency variables measuring reward anticipation and response (1) differentiate, in age- and sex-matched subsamples, (i) youth with vs. without ADHD, (ii) youth at-risk for vs. not at-risk for ADHD, and, in the with ADHD subsample, (iii) youth with the inattentive vs. the hyperactive/impulsive (H/I) and combined presentations. We further examined the extent to which ERP variables (2) predict, in the ADHD subsample, substance use (i) concurrently and (ii) prospectively at 18-month follow-up. Linear support vector machine analyses indicated ERPs weakly differentiate youth with/without (65%) – and at-risk for/not at-risk for (63%) – ADHD but better differentiate ADHD presentations (78%). Regression analyses showed in adolescents with ADHD, ERPs explain a considerable proportion of variance (50%) in concurrent alcohol use and, controlling for concurrent marijuana and tobacco use, explain a considerable proportion of variance (87 and 87%) in, and predict later marijuana and tobacco use. Findings are consistent with the dual-pathway model of ADHD. Results also highlight limitations of a dichotomous, syndromic classification and indicate differences in neural reinforcement sensitivity are a promising ADHD prognostic biomarker.}

	abstract = {Abstract College student mental health has been a critical concern for professional counselors. Anxiety and depressive disorders have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. Utilizing machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), we developed predictive models (i.e., eXtreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost], Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression) to identify US college students at heightened risk of diagnosable anxiety and depressive disorders. The dataset included 61,619 students from 133 US higher education institutions and was partitioned into a 90:10 ratio for training and testing the models. We employed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance and examined multiple measures of predictive performance (e.g., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], accuracy, sensitivity). Results revealed strong discriminative power in our machine learning predictive models with AUC of 0.74 and 0.77, indicating current financial situation, sense of belonging on campus, disability status, and age as the top predictors of anxiety and depressive disorders. This study provides a practical tool for professional counselors to proactively identify students for anxiety and depressive disorders before these conditions escalate. Application of machine learning in counseling research provides data-driven insights that help enhance the understanding of mental health determinants, guide prevention and intervention strategies, and promote the well-being of diverse student populations through counseling.}
